        <p>The Noble Kaaba, a tall building in the heart of the Holy Mosque of Mecca, to which the hearts of Muslims yearn for it, and it is the first house placed on earth for the worship of God alone with no partner, and it is the focus of attention and the kiss of Muslims.

The Kaaba was called due to its cubic, which is its square and every tall building, a “Kaaba,” and Al-Nawawi said, “It was called that because of its roundness and height, and it was said that it was originally squared.”

The relationship is close and eternal between the Holy Kaaba since its construction and its near geographical surroundings, which we mean the Grand Mosque, and this proximity between them led to a consideration of the increase in the areas of the Grand Mosque since the dawn of the prophethood, in order to allow Muslims to perform their rituals in reverence and reassurance.</p>
        
        <h2>Kaaba history</h2>
        
        <p>
        The history of the Kaaba stretches back to pre-Christian times. According to Islamic tradition, the archangel Gabriel appeared to Abraham (known to Muslims as Ibrahim), and instructed him and his son Ishmael to build a shrine in Makkah.

The ritual of pilgrimage to the Kaaba is believed by Muslims to stretch back to the time of Abraham, although it was re-affirmed by the Prophet Muhammad in the 7th century.
